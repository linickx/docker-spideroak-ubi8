# docker-spideroak-ubi8
A Docker Container for SpiderOakONE

AKA: Yet another SpiderOakOne Container, a version with a few personal preferences üòù

## Security & Stability

This image is based on the [Redhat UBI](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) version 8, which is based on Redhat Enterprise Linux 8. RHEL is a very slow, very stable version of linux, something you want in backup software!

The container build also will fail if the GPG Key/Signature of the RPM fails, helping prevent any supply chain attacks. Also, the container can run rootless, a [non-root account runs](https://spideroak.support/hc/en-us/articles/115004777903-Running-as-Root-on-Linux) the SpiderOak process and your container manager doesn't need to run as root.

## Simplicity
This container can get up and running with 1x command...

    docker run -ti -e USERNAME="nick" -e PASSWORD="password" -v /home/nick/important_files:/home/important_files linickx/spideroak-ubi8

Although, you don't have to do it like that, this will also work:

    docker run -ti linickx/spideroak-ubi8

However, you will need to connect to a shell to enter your credentials, and of course no external files can be backed up.

## Notes

The `docs` directory has an example docker-compose, both a simple and more advanced version.

### Credential Security

Environment variables can be exposed on docker hosts with the `inspect` command, SpiderOak doesn't need the password each time, after initial setup everything is stored in the `/spideroak/.config` directory.

If you really don't like ENV VARS then you have a couple of further choices, either get a shell and run the setup command manually, or create & mount `/spideroak/config.json` [manually](https://spideroak.support/hc/en-us/articles/115001893283--setup)

## SpiderOak CLI Parameters

By default, SpiderOakOne starts with `-v --headless` if you want to do something else like `--batchmode` then set the environment variable `$HEADLESS_PARAMETERS`
